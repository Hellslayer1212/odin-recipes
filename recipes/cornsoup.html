            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a small pot of water to a boil</li>
                    <li>Add in a whole can of corn kernels</li>
                    <li>Once it starts to boil again, add in the chicken powder</li>
                    <li>Taste to measure the savouriness of the soup, if it isn't flavourful enough add another tablespoon of chicken powder</li>
                    <li>Once you are satisfied with the taste, take the soup off the heat and slowly add in the scrambled egg, making sure that it is going in the soup as a strand in a <em>circular</em> motion</li>
                    <li>Mix the corn starch with one tablespoon of water thoroughly to make a slurry making sure not to leave any lumps as well as clumps of dry corn starch and add to the soup, stir constantly for 15 seconds</li>
                    <li>The soup is now ready to serve, add white pepper to taste and enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
