My current project is to create a simple recipe website.

I will return to this README once I have finished the website to self-reflect.

Self Reflection: I had a lot of fun making this website. I know it's the first project but to try my hand at creating a functional website in practice as well as in utility, I have to say The Odin Project is meeting my expectations in making me feel like learning to be a developer is possible.

I know it's still the start and that I've taken my time getting to this point but I'll continue at this and I hope that I'll be able to continue creating new projects that I can be just as proud of, if not more.
